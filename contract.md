## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

I want to be confident in my ability to implement DSLs. At the moment, I know how to do somethings, but I haven't done them enough to be confident. 

Along with skills and confidence, I would also like to have an actual, usable DSL by the end of this project 

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

The in-class puzzles and Piconot helped me understand how to implement new datatypes, new loop syntax, parsers, etc. I would like to use these, and get used to these over the course of this project. The project largely involves 

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

Have a set time to work on my DSL. Maybe Tuesday 11am-2 and Saturday 9am-12. If that is insufficient, I can always alot more time. The project has several smaller "features" to be implemented, and these can be intermediate milestones. I would like to create a new datatype, one new loop structure and few features and functions that can be added to these. 

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_
